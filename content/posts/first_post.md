# Welcome to my corner!

Hello! My name is David Saiz, and I am a 22-year-old engineer that has been working on RPAS technology. After spending so much time debugging with stackoverflow posts and Medium blogs as my best comrades, I have decided to also share some of my knowledge and documentation I have been creating for the last years. I have also been wanting to create an outlet for those small projects to keep myself motivated to go through them. Sharing the advancements might be enough to keep me working on them, and finally taking some of them out of the back of my mind. 

This will be my small garden, and I will try to keep it as green and complete as possible. If you end up falling in here, don't hesitate to say hi! I wish you find some of the posts useful to finish your own projects too :D
